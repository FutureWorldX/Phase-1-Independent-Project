## Introduction
#### Description and Problem Statement
* Small to medium-sized insurance agencies often rely on Microsoft Excel and Access files for entering client data. The data that these insurance agents fill can be categorized into Insurance Registry, Claims Registry, Underwriting, Accounting Information and Reports. 
* However, these files may only be opened one at a time by one agent on one PC in the agency. This means that the document file must first be closed by one agent before another agent in the insurance agency can get a chance to edit the file. Also, there might be several copies of the file which makes it hard to track down customer information. 

## Getting Started
Developing a web-based data entry form so that the same database can be accessed and shared among multiple staff members within an insurance agency. A logbook or version history can also be tracked via date and time when changes are made to the database.

### Minimum Viable Product

1. Preloading Class Of Policy and Commision Rates which are standardized by the Kenya Insurance Regulatory Authority.

2. The Manager or Administrator users can add, update or delete customer details and the insurer companies based on agency activity.

3. The Insurance Agent can add or update insurance claims and renewal details.
